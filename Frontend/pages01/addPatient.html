            A hospital is a healthcare institution providing patient treatment with specialized health science and
            auxiliary healthcare staff and medical equipment.[1] The best-known type of hospital is the general
            hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and
            accident victims to a sudden illness. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its
            region, with many beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-zoom-in">

            Specialized hospitals include trauma centers, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, geriatric
            hospitals, and hospitals for specific medical needs, such as psychiatric hospitals for psychiatric treatment
            and other disease-specific categories. Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to
            general hospitals.[2] Hospitals are classified as general, specialty, or government depending on the sources
            of income received.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-zoom-in">

            A teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to health science students and auxiliary
            healthcare students. A health science facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic.
            Hospitals have a range of departments (e.g. surgery and urgent care) and specialist units such as
            cardiology. Some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have chronic treatment units. Common support
            units include a pharmacy, pathology, and radiology.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-zoom-in">

            Hospitals are typically funded by public funding, health organizations (for-profit or nonprofit), health
            insurance companies, or charities, including direct charitable donations. Historically, hospitals were often
            founded and funded by religious orders, or by charitable individuals and leaders.[3]
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-zoom-in">

            Hospitals are currently staffed by professional physicians, surgeons, nurses, and allied health
            practitioners. In the past, however, this work was usually performed by the members of founding religious
            orders or by volunteers. However, there are various Catholic religious orders, such as the Alexians and the
            Bon Secours Sisters that still focus on hospital ministry in the late 1990s, as well as several other
            Christian denominations, including the Methodists and Lutherans, which run hospitals.[4] In accordance with
            the original meaning of the word, hospitals were original "places of hospitality", and this meaning is still
            preserved in the names of some institutions such as the Royal Hospital Chelsea, established in 1681 as a
            retirement and nursing home for veteran soldiers.
